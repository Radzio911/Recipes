Ingredients:

9 lasagna noodles
500g ground beef
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
800g tomato sauce
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
50g butter
50g all-purpose flour
500ml milk
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
200g shredded mozzarella cheese
50g grated Parmesan cheese
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

In a large skillet, sauté the onion and garlic in butter until softened. Add the ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes.

In a saucepan, prepare the béchamel sauce: melt the butter, add the flour, stir, and cook for 1-2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook the sauce until it thickens. Add nutmeg and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Boil lasagna noodles in a large pot of water according to package instructions. Drain.

In a large baking dish, layer the meat sauce, followed by a layer of noodles, then another layer of meat sauce, and finally a layer of béchamel sauce. Repeat this process until you've used all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of béchamel sauce.

Sprinkle shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.

Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown.

Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
